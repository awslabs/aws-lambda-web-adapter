# FastAPI with Lambda SnapStart (container image)

This example shows how to use the Lambda Web Adapter's SnapStart hooks to drain and
re-establish a connection pool around the snapshot/restore boundary, packaged as a
**container image** (OCI) rather than a zip.

For the zip-packaged equivalent, see
[fastapi-snapstart-zip](../fastapi-snapstart-zip).

## How does it work?

The [Dockerfile](app/Dockerfile) copies the Lambda Web Adapter binary into
`/opt/extensions`:

```dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:3.12-slim
COPY --from=public.ecr.aws/awsguru/aws-lambda-adapter:1.1.0 /lambda-adapter /opt/extensions/lambda-adapter
ENV PORT=8000
WORKDIR /var/task
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY *.py ./
CMD exec uvicorn --port=$PORT main:app
```

The two SnapStart hook endpoints are configured as function environment variables in
[`template.yaml`](template.yaml), keeping the image itself generic:

```yaml
      Environment:
        Variables:
          AWS_LWA_SNAPSTART_BEFORE_CHECKPOINT_PATH: /snapstart/before
          AWS_LWA_SNAPSTART_AFTER_RESTORE_PATH: /snapstart/after
```

When the function runs under SnapStart, the adapter calls your application at the
snapshot boundary:

- **Before the snapshot** — `AWS_LWA_SNAPSTART_BEFORE_CHECKPOINT_PATH` is set to
  `/snapstart/before`. The adapter sends an empty HTTP `POST` to this path. The app uses
  it to drain and close resources that will not survive the snapshot (in this example,
  it closes the connection pool).
- **After restore**, before traffic is served, the adapter performs three steps in
  order:
  1. It refreshes its own HTTP connection to the inner app, so it never reuses a
     connection captured in the snapshot (this is automatic — you do not configure or
     manage the adapter's client).
  2. `AWS_LWA_SNAPSTART_AFTER_RESTORE_PATH` is set to `/snapstart/after`. The adapter
     sends an empty HTTP `POST` to this path over the refreshed connection. The app uses
     it to re-establish connections and regenerate per-environment unique values (in
     this example, it reconnects the pool and generates a fresh `connection_id`).
  3. It re-runs the readiness check against your app before admitting traffic.

Both hook routes must return a `2xx` status code. A non-2xx response or a connection
failure fails the SnapStart phase. The adapter sets no deadline of its own — the
after-restore hook must finish within the function timeout (`10` seconds here).
The readiness check runs on every restore; by default it waits indefinitely for the
app to recover, but you can bound it with `AWS_LWA_READINESS_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
(fractional seconds allowed), in which case a restore whose app does not report
ready within that timeout fails — so traffic is never served against an app that has
not finished recovering.

These hook routes are protected **on the Lambda invocation path**: the 403 guard
lives in the adapter, which only sits in front of your app when it is processing
Lambda events, so external callers that reach the function via API Gateway or ALB
and request `/snapstart/before` or `/snapstart/after` receive a `403 Forbidden`.

> **Warning:** that guard exists only when the adapter is in the request path.
> Because the adapter is packaged inside the image, the same container also runs
> unchanged on Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or a local Docker host (`docker run -p
> 8000:8000` below) — but in those deployments traffic goes straight to your app
> and the guard is not present. `/snapstart/before` and `/snapstart/after` are
> state-mutating (this example closes and re-establishes the connection pool), so
> outside Lambda you must not expose them publicly, or protect them yourself.

## Pre-requisites

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [SAM CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Build and Deploy

Build the container image and deploy with SAM:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

When the deployment completes, take note of the `FastAPISnapStartApi` output — it is
the API Gateway endpoint URL.

## Verify it works

Open the API URL in a browser or with `curl`:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
```

The response reports the connection state, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello from FastAPI on Lambda SnapStart (container image)",
  "connected": true,
  "connection_id": 426384719
}
```

After a SnapStart restore, the `connection_id` is regenerated rather than shared across
every restored environment, because the adapter calls the after-restore hook
(`/snapstart/after`), which reconnects the pool and generates a fresh id. This is
exactly the behavior you want for any per-environment value (connections, random seeds,
unique identifiers) that must not be duplicated across restored snapshots.

## Run the container locally

The same image runs locally — without SnapStart, the hooks are simply never invoked:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 {ECR Image}
curl localhost:8000/
```
