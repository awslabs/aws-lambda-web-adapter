# Spring Boot 2 Zip example

A basic pet store application written with the Spring Boot 2 framework. You can build and test it locally as a typical Spring Boot 2 application.

The application can be deployed in an AWS account using the [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). The `template.yaml` file in the root folder contains the application definition.

To run the application we are using the run.sh script located in the resources folder:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

exec java -cp "./:lib/*" "com.amazonaws.demo.petstore.Application" "--server.port=${PORT}"
```

In the configuration we have to specify the AWS Lambda adapter as a layer and configure the script as handler:

```yaml
 Properties:
      MemorySize: 512
      Handler: run.sh
      CodeUri: app/
      Runtime: java11
      AutoPublishAlias: live
      SnapStart:
        ApplyOn: PublishedVersions      
      Environment:
        Variables:
          PORT: 8000
          RUST_LOG: info
          READINESS_CHECK_PATH: /healthz
          REMOVE_BASE_PATH: /v1
          AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER: /opt/bootstrap
      Layers:
        - !Sub arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:753240598075:layer:LambdaAdapterLayerX86:25
```

In this template, we enable SnapStart for this function. SnapStart drastically reduces cold start time for Java functions using Firecracker MicroVM snapshotting technology. Read more about SnapStart [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html).

### Remove the base path

The pet store application is deployed under /v1/{proxy+}. But the application does not know that. So in the SAM template file, we configured environment variable `REMOVE_BASE_PATH=/v1`.
This configuration tells the Adapter to remove `/v1` from http request path, so that the pet store application works without changing code.

## Pre-requisites

The following tools should be installed and configured.

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Deploy to Lambda

Navigate to the sample's folder and use the SAM CLI to build the application:

```shell
sam build
```

This command compiles the application and prepares a deployment package in the `.aws-sam` sub-directory.

To deploy the application in your AWS account, you can use the SAM CLI's guided deployment process and follow the instructions on the screen

```shell
sam deploy --guided
```

Once the deployment is completed, the SAM CLI will print out the stack's outputs, including the new application URL. You can use `curl` or a web browser to make a call to the URL

```shell
...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OutputKey-Description                        OutputValue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PetStoreApi - URL for application            https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/pets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...

curl https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/pets
```

## Local test with SAM CLI

In general, you can test your web app locally without simulating AWS Lambda execution environment. But if you want to simulate Lambda and API Gateway locally, you can use SAM CLI.

```shell
sam local start-api --warm-containers EAGER --region us-west-2
```

This command will start a local http endpoint and docker container to simulate API Gateway and Lambda. Please modify the region to match the actual region you are using. You can test it using `curl`, `postman`, and web browser.

## Clean up

This example use provisioned concurrency to reduce cold start time. It incurs additional cost. You can remove the whole example with the following command.

```shell
sam delete
```
