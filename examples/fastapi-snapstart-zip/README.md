# FastAPI with Lambda SnapStart

This example shows how to use Lambda Web Adapter's SnapStart hooks to drain and re-establish a connection pool around the snapshot/restore boundary, running a FastAPI application on the managed python runtime.

### How does it work?

We add the Lambda Web Adapter layer to the function and configure the wrapper script.

1. attach Lambda Adapter layer to your function. This layer contains the Lambda Adapter binary and a wrapper script.
    1. x86_64: `arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:753240598075:layer:LambdaAdapterLayerX86:30`
    2. arm64: `arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:753240598075:layer:LambdaAdapterLayerArm64:30`
2. configure Lambda environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` to `/opt/bootstrap`. This is a wrapper script included in the layer.
3. set function handler to a startup command: `run.sh`. The wrapper script will execute this command to boot up your application.

To get more information of Wrapper script, please read Lambda documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-modify.html#runtime-wrapper).

#### SnapStart hooks

[Lambda SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) initializes your function, takes a snapshot of the initialized execution environment, and restores from that snapshot to serve invocations. Some resources do not survive the snapshot (open connections) and some values must not be shared across every restored environment (unique ids, seeds). The Lambda Web Adapter bridges the SnapStart lifecycle to your inner web app through two opt-in environment variables:

- **Before the snapshot** — `AWS_LWA_SNAPSTART_BEFORE_CHECKPOINT_PATH` is set to `/snapstart/before`. The adapter sends an empty HTTP `POST` to this path. The app uses it to drain and close resources that will not survive the snapshot (in this example, it closes the connection pool).
- **After restore**, before traffic is served, the adapter performs three steps in order:
  1. It refreshes its own HTTP connection to the inner app, so it never reuses a connection captured in the snapshot (this is automatic — you do not configure or manage the adapter's client).
  2. `AWS_LWA_SNAPSTART_AFTER_RESTORE_PATH` is set to `/snapstart/after`. The adapter sends an empty HTTP `POST` to this path over the refreshed connection. The app uses it to re-establish connections and regenerate per-environment unique values (in this example, it reconnects the pool and generates a fresh `connection_id`).
  3. It re-runs the readiness check against your app before admitting traffic.

Both hook routes must return a `2xx` status code. A non-2xx response or a connection failure fails the SnapStart phase. The adapter sets no deadline of its own — the after-restore hook must finish within the function timeout (`10` seconds in this template). The readiness check runs on every restore; by default it waits indefinitely for the app to recover, but you can bound it with `AWS_LWA_READINESS_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (fractional seconds allowed), in which case a restore whose app does not report ready within that timeout fails — so traffic is never served against an app that has not finished recovering.

These hook routes are protected on the Lambda invocation path: the 403 guard lives in the adapter, which only sits in front of your app while it processes Lambda events, so external callers that reach the function (via API Gateway or ALB) and request `/snapstart/before` or `/snapstart/after` receive a `403 Forbidden`. (The guard exists only when the adapter is in the request path — if you run your app without the adapter, protect or don't expose these state-mutating routes yourself.)

### Build and Deploy

Run the following commands to build and deploy the application to lambda.

```bash
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided
```
When the deployment completes, take note of FastAPISnapStartApi's Value. It is the API Gateway endpoint URL.

### Verify it works

Open FastAPISnapStartApi's URL in a browser. The `/` response shows `connected: true` and a `connection_id`, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello from FastAPI on Lambda SnapStart",
  "connected": true,
  "connection_id": 482913007
}
```

After a SnapStart restore, the `connection_id` is regenerated rather than shared across every restored environment, because the adapter calls the after-restore hook (`/snapstart/after`), which reconnects the pool and generates a fresh id. This is exactly the behavior you want for any per-environment value (connections, random seeds, unique identifiers) that must not be duplicated across restored snapshots.
